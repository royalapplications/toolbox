### New scripts

- **The right place**: The repository should stay clearly structured, to provide a good overview. Each script should have their own directory, containing all relevant files, like screenshots and documentation.
- **Permissions**: Make sure you are allowed to share the script with the public. Publish it under the same [license](LICENSE) of this repository. By comitting/posting pull requests, you agree with this.
- **Documentation**: Your shared script contains enough documentation/instructions that other users are able to easily understand the purpose and are able to use it without a lot of guesswork.
- **Stay clean**: Your code should be as clean, smart and understandable as possible. Prevent having any magic, encrypted or obfuscated code.

### Modifying existing scripts

- **Credits**: Please respect previous authors and leave them intact. If you feel you've done great enhancements to existing scripts, feel free to add yourself to the authors list.
- **Compatibility**: Don't forget about backwards-compatibility. Try not to break existing scripts. If you're doing changes regarding parameters, dependencies or any other major changes, please create a new script directory or new files within the same folder.

Okay with the few points above? Great! Go ahead and create a pull request with your contribution. Thanks a lot! :-)
